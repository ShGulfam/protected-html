Future Improvements
Enhanced Security: Implement more robust password protection mechanisms, such as hashing or a more secure authentication system.
User Roles: Introduce different user roles with varying access levels (e.g., student, teacher, admin).
File Management: Integrate a more sophisticated file management system instead of relying on external links. This could involve storing files on the school's server or using a dedicated document management platform.
Document Types: Expand the types of documents available online (e.g., date sheets, syllabus, announcements).
User Interface: Improve the user interface with better navigation and search functionality.
Accessibility: Improve accessibility features for users with disabilities.
This project provides a basic framework for managing and controlling access to school documents online. By implementing the suggested improvements, it can be further developed into a more comprehensive and secure platform for sharing information with students, staff, and parents.
